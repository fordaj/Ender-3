# Direct Drive
[Thing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3589452/files) by [Madau3D](https://www.thingiverse.com/madau3d/designs). A simple bracket fixing the extruder a short distance above the hotend. One consideration is that the extruder stepper motor wire will be too short without reducing the length of the hotend cables. This is not required with a Hemera installed.
### Considerations
Your nozzle choice, as well as printer settings, may change the length of PTFE tubing required for assembly. I have found that 10cm of PTFE tubing snugs the extruder stepper against the upper limits of the bracket with the Capricorn PTFE attachments.

[Thing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4369859) by [eric-anastas](https://www.thingiverse.com/eric-anastas/designs). Redesigned by me to fit the E3D Volcano heater block, and to mount the Duet IR probe clone.
### Considerations
Drilled out holes in part cooling fan to use M3 socket head bolts instead of M2. I find that M2 bolts, as well as button head M3 bolts will strip and wear down the allen wrenches. M3 socket head bolts use a larger M4 sized Allen wrench, allowing for plenty of torquing before failure.
